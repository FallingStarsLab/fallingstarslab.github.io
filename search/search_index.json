An intelligent being should be able to realize the suffering of other sentient beings and have compassion and empathy for them, not killing other sentient beings for their benefit.</p> <p>Perhaps seeking pleasure and avoiding pain is our nature. Human has five senses, and each sense has its pleasure. Sight, we want to see beautiful landscapes, we desire beautiful women. Hearing, we want to hear pleasurable sounds, the softness of a woman's voice, the peaceful sound of the morning on a mountain. Taste, we seek delicious food from around the world, and we want to taste the best wine. Smell, we want to smell all the pleasurable perfume. Touch, we desire for sexual pleasure, which is one of the greatest desires a person has. I believe it is not wrong to seek pleasure for yourself, but it is wrong if the pleasure you are seeking directly or indirectly causes suffering to any other sentient being. By suffering, I mean either mental distress or physical pain inflicted on a sentient being. My reasoning is simple, If you don\u2019t want to suffer, then you don\u2019t make others suffer.</p> <p>Then, why do we as intelligent beings create so much suffering on animals in exchange for the temporal pleasure of our mouths? Have we ever asked ourselves if the suffering these animals endure is worth the pleasure we gain by eating their flesh? There is no one with a rational mind can say yes to that question. If you are a normal person without any mental disorder, then there is a high chance that you once had a feeling of guilt deep inside your heart when you ate that burger or that chicken fried, you know deep down in your soul that it is wrong and to have that flesh, a cow, a chicken was killed young and intentionally, for you one to have that tasty flesh. Killing an innocent sentient being is immoral, but raising it for the whole purpose of killing it for one\u2019s pleasure is psychologically broken. There is no justification to justify the act of killing for food because humans are omnivores, which means we don\u2019t need meat to survive, we are not carnivores like lions or tigers.</p> <p>Now, even if we all agree that there is no justification for our killing for taste, some people would argue that it doesn\u2019t matter, in the end, humans only live once in this world, and after they die nothing matters anymore. It\u2019s a very selfish argument. It is true that after one dies, one is done with this world, and nothing in this world can affect him anymore, assuming that he doesn\u2019t believe in the afterlife and karma kinds of stuff, but why would one want to give away suffering while he is avoiding it? he knows how unpleasant it is to have a bleeding cut on his leg, but his food requires slitting the throat of another sentient being to death, how horrifying the physical and psychological that animal had suffered to deliver the meat for that barbecue? does anyone ever think about it?</p> <p>Some may continue to argue that the animals he eats are humanly killed, the word humanly means \u201ctypical of human behaviors, thoughts, and feelings\u201d, but when it is a norm to kill for food without any regard for the sentient animal that being killed, the word humanly doesn\u2019t imply anything correlated with morality, it only implies that is the common way to do because everyone else does it. In a world where immorality is the norm, morality becomes the new immorality.</p> <p>Are we so blinded by the media, the culture, the norm around us, and especially our desire for pleasure that we decided to close our eyes and allow this madness to continue? We are born with empathy and compassion, it is our nature but the environment around us has changed us to be ignorance. Do you remember when you were a little, how terrifying it was when you realized where the fried chicken and the steak on your plate came from? or at least have you ever witnessed that terrifying reaction from a child? or how many times do you hear a child tell his mother that he wants to be a vegan but receives a laugh from his mother?</p> <p>Open your mind and try to face the truth. Our world is a hell for any species that is considered edible or tasty for humans. Ignoring it doesn\u2019t solve the problem, the only way to make our world better for all living beings is to bravely face the truth and make small but consistent decisions every time you ask yourself what to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Your effort alone may not change the established industry, but what you will receive is free from guilt, you will no longer have that guilt of indirectly causing suffering to animals before you sleep, and you will be proud of yourself for making such a brave decision to go against the madness of this world. Together, we can gradually make this planet a heaven for all species to live and enjoy their lives.</p> <p>Small decisions do have the ability to cause great results. Even one meal of meat-free count. If you have the luxury of choosing what to eat, then choose not to eat flesh. Our lives in this physical realm are short, if we all want to live happy lives then we should allow them to at least live their lives too.</p>"},{"location":"where-to-happiness/","title":"What is your life\u2019s purpose?","text":"<p>Every morning, what specific thing first appears in your thoughts that pulls you up from the bed and makes you start thinking about it? is it the same thing that keeps you awake at night, but you convinced yourself to go to sleep so that the next day you can have the energy to think more and better about it? If you have such a thing, it is a privilege, and remember that not everyone has that.</p> <p>I remember having a few such things in my life, one of them is the game that I was very excited about, it was the motivation that woke me up early every morning and the reason that kept me awake at night and had to force myself to go to sleep so that I can have a better time for it the next day. Another such thing that happened to me was the time I had my first girlfriend, she was the most beautiful girl in my eyes, and I thought about her every time I had a chance throughout the day, then smiled to myself. I don\u2019t know if it was happiness, but it felt better than me today. What goes up will go down, the state of your mind is not an exception.</p> <p>Sometimes, you have the feeling of emptiness, you lost your passion for the things you once loved, you lost your hope in life, and you are just in the middle of accepting a boring and repetitive life, but you would never want to accept it, another half of your soul want to continue to hope that one day everything will be better. And you will never know what will the future have for you, that\u2019s why you continue to keep your hope. Then life hits you, after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years of repetitive life, you start to think is this it? is this life? when you were a little, you imagined that adult life would be very interesting and have a lot of things to offer, but no, now you are an adult and you realize that your life is boring and you don\u2019t know how to escape that boring life.</p> <p>Then what to do in such a situation? you need to find something to devote yourself to that, something that you truly believe in. Don\u2019t chase money, when you die none of the money you made will mean anything. Chase something that you truly believe is the right thing to do, something that when you die, still lives. Something that you will be proud of yourself when you are on your dead bed thinking about it, knowing that you had tried to make this world a better place, knowing that although you die, your legacy continues to live and continue to give happiness, or a chance to be happy, to every soul.</p> <p>When you do something that can reduce and eliminate the suffering of other souls, it will heal your soul knowing that other souls are at peace and you are one of the reasons for it to happen. When you are in your final seconds of life, you will not regret your life.</p>"},{"location":"why-arent-you-happy/","title":"Why aren't you happy yet?","text":"<p>Are you in a happy state now? when is the last time you experience happiness, or the state of no pain, or the feeling of inner peace? is it too long ago that you can\u2019t even remember?</p> <p>Happiness seems like a luxury item to possess, sometimes it is just too far to reach no matter how hard you try, and sometimes you just don\u2019t even know if it will ever be for you. Sometimes, you just think that you don\u2019t deserve it. Happiness is just a state of inner peace, a state in which you don\u2019t have any regret about your past or any worry or anxiety for the undetermined future. When you focus on your present moment, stop thinking about what will your future be. Yes, I learned that from the book \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d, but it seems like I still can not save myself even with all these supposed to be the right tools, right thoughts, and right paths to inner peace. Why is that? Is it because deep inside, You don\u2019t want to be happy? or is it because too much pain has made you addicted to it that you subconsciously seek it without knowing? You just don\u2019t know. The past keeps haunting you with all the \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions.</p> <p>What if I didn\u2019t leave my dogs, would he still be with me? did my dogs hate me for leaving them for too long? now only god knows if he or she even exists. I left my dogs, one of them died because we didn\u2019t feed her properly, plus she probably suffered so much loneliness and depression because my other dog left us, or someone has captured and killed him for his flesh. I don\u2019t know and will never know the real reason, but I will never be able to stop torturing myself with the thought that it was because I left him, he was lonely and that is why he left. Now is he still alive? I don\u2019t know, did he suffer? did someone kill him for his flesh? did he get lost and die of hunger? I don\u2019t know, but the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d seems to hurt me more than anything. I regret that I left him for so long, I regret that I did not spend more time with him, I regret that I did not treat him better. But those words don\u2019t mean anything, he probably was dead. What is more terrifying is, that I knew that one day they would leave me, I knew that as a fact because they can not live that long compared to my life, but still I didn\u2019t treat them well. I was a bad owner, I was the only person they had but I failed them. Now, if there are afterlives, I can only wish for them to have a happy life, and become whatever they want because being a human doesn\u2019t guarantee them a happy life, but when it comes to suffering, there is no lower limit. But is there even after life? I don\u2019t know, if nothing like that exists, then it is it. They died. It\u2019s over. They had only one life to live and I failed them.</p> <p>If you think that is pathetic, then yes because it is.</p> <p>The people in my country eat dogs. Don\u2019t they have anything else to eat? is it just their preference to make the dogs and their owners suffer? I don\u2019t know. But it is wrong. If I am to ask everyone on this earth if anyone wants to suffer the feeling of an owner whose dog was killed for their flesh, how many do you think would say yes? do they even know how it feels? perhaps only the people who experience the feeling themself can truly know the pain. Presumably, no one wants to experience this pain, so why do they cause it to others? did the flesh taste good? did you think that it was worth it? did you know that for every dog you killed, how much suffering was inflicted on the owner? Maybe you know but you still do it for the taste, or for the money you would gain, or you just don\u2019t care at all.</p> <p>Why is that? To be born as a human is a privilege, and you use that privilege to give away suffering.</p> <p>If there are afterlives and karma, one who causes suffering will pay for it. If there is nothing like that at all, then you should value others\u2019 lives even higher because they only have one chance to live and to be happy, why would you take it from them just for the minutes of your pleasure?</p> <p>Maybe, in the end, pleasure is the one to blame, or maybe it is the person himself, his consciousness, and his ignorance is what to blame. It doesn\u2019t matter, the result is this world instead of being a nurturing place for every being to live, becomes a killing field for humans, a hell for all the beings that are edible, or even worse, beings that are considered tasty for humans.</p> <p>This is madness, and you need to wake up to this madness, or even for one more thousand years, or millions of years, this world is still a place full of suffering.</p>"},{"location":"archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"category/happiness/","title":"happiness","text":""},{"location":"category/animal/","title":"animal","text":""}]}

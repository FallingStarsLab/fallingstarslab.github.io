title: Why aren't you happy yet?
---

Are you in a happy state now? when is the last time you experience happiness, or the state of no pain, or the feeling of inner peace? is it too long ago that you can’t even remember?

Happiness seems like a luxury item to possess, sometimes it is just too far to reach no matter how hard you try, and sometimes you just don’t even know if it will ever be for you. Sometimes, you just think that you don’t deserve it. Happiness is just a state of inner peace, a state in which you don’t have any regret about your past or any worry or anxiety for the undetermined future. When you focus on your present moment, stop thinking about what will your future be. Yes, I learned that from the book “The Power of Now”, but it seems like I still can not save myself even with all these supposed to be the right tools, right thoughts, and right path to inner peace. Why is that? Is it because deep inside, You don’t want to be happy? or is it because too much pain has made you addicted to it that you subconsciously seek it without knowing? You just don’t know. The past keeps haunting you with all the “what if?” questions.

What if I didn’t leave my dogs, would he still be with me? did my dogs hate me for leaving them for too long? now only god knows if he or she even exists. I left my dogs, one of them died because we didn’t feed her properly, plus she probably suffered so much loneliness and depression because my other dog left us, I don’t know and will never know the real reason, but I will never be able to stop torturing myself with the thought that it was because I left him, he was lonely and that is why he left. Now is he still alive? I don’t know, did he suffer? did someone kill him for his flesh? did he get lost and die of hunger? I don’t know, but the “don’t know” seems to hurt me more than anything. I regret that I left him for so long, I regret that I did not spend more time with him, I regret that I did not treat him better. But those words don’t mean anything, he probably was dead. What is more terrifying is, that I knew that one day they would leave me, I knew that as a fact because they can not live that long compared to my life, but still I didn’t treat them well. I was a bad owner, I was the only person they had but I failed them. Now, if there are afterlives, I can only wish for them to have a happy life, and become whatever they want because being a human doesn’t guarantee you a happy life, but when it comes to suffering, it will be the greatest level of suffering. But is there even after life? I don’t know, if nothing like that exists, then it is it. They died. It’s over. They had only one life to live and I failed them.

If you think that is pathetic, then yes because it is.

The people in my country eat dogs. Don’t they have anything else to eat? is it just their preference to make the dogs and their owners suffer? I don’t know. But it is wrong. If I am to ask everyone on this earth if anyone wants to suffer the feeling of an owner whose dog was killed for their flesh, how many do you think would say yes? do they even know how it feels? perhaps only the people who experience the feeling themself can truly know the pain. Presumably, no one wants to experience this pain, so why do they cause it to others? did the flesh taste good? did you think that it was worth it? did you know that for every dog you killed, how much suffering was inflicted on the owner? Maybe you know but you still do it for the taste, or for the money you would gain, or you just don’t care at all.

Why is that? To be born as a human is a privilege, and you use that privilege to give away suffering.

If there are afterlives and karma, one who causes suffering will pay for it. If there is nothing like that at all, then you should value others’ lives even higher because they only have one chance to live and to be happy, why would you take it from them just for the minutes of your pleasure?

Maybe, in the end, pleasure is the one to blame, or maybe it is the person himself, his consciousness, and his ignorance is what to blame. It doesn’t matter, the result is this world instead of being a nurturing place for every being to live, becomes a killing field for humans, a hell for all the beings that are edible, or even worse, beings that are considered tasty for humans.

This is madness, and you need to wake up to this madness, or even for one more thousand years, or millions of years, this world is still a place full of suffering.

title: What is your life’s purpose?
---

Every morning, what specific thing first appears in your thoughts that pulls you up from the bed and makes you start thinking about it? is it the same thing that keeps you awake at night, but you convinced yourself to go to sleep so that the next day you can have the energy to think more and better about it? If you have such a thing, it is a privilege, and remember that not everyone has that.

I remember having a few such things in my life, one of them is the game that I was very excited about, it was the motivation that woke me up early every morning and the reason that kept me awake at night and had to force myself to go to sleep so that I can have a better time for it the next day. Another such thing that happened to me was the time I had my first girlfriend, she was the most beautiful girl in my eyes, and I thought about her every time I had a chance throughout the day, then smiled to myself. I don’t know if it was happiness, but it felt better than me today. What goes up will go down, the state of your mind is not an exception.

Sometimes, you have the feeling of emptiness, you lost your passion for the things you once loved, you lost your hope in life, and you are just in the middle of accepting a boring and repetitive life, but you would never want to accept it, another half of your soul want to continue to hope that one day everything will be better. And you will never know what will the future have for you, that’s why you continue to keep your hope. Then life hits you, after 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years of repetitive life, you start to think is this it? is this life? when you were a little, you imagined that adult life would be very interesting and have a lot of things to offer, but no, now you are an adult and you realize that your life is boring and you don’t know how to escape that boring life.

Then what to do in such a situation? you need to find something to devote yourself to that, something that you truly believe in. Don’t chase money, when you die none of the money you made will mean anything. Chase something that you truly believe is the right thing to do, something that when you die, still lives. Something that you will be proud of yourself when you are on your dead bed thinking about it, knowing that you had tried to make this world a better place, knowing that although you die, your legacy continues to live and continue to give happiness, or a chance to be happy, to every soul.

When you do something that can reduce and eliminate the suffering of other souls, it will heal your soul knowing that other souls are at peace and you are one of the reasons for it to happen. When you are in your final seconds of life, you will not regret your life.

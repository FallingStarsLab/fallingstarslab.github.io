title: Is this world fundamentally broken?

Human perceives themself as highly intelligent and as the master of this world, but their actions seem to contradict that. An intelligent being should be able to realize the suffering of other sentient beings and have compassion and empathy for them, not killing other sentient beings for their benefit.

Human perceives themself as highly intelligent and as the master of this world, but their actions seem to contradict that. An intelligent being should be able to realize the suffering of other sentient beings and have compassion and empathy for them, not killing other sentient beings for their benefit.

Perhaps seeking pleasure and avoiding pain is our nature. Human has five senses, and each sense has its pleasure. Sight, we want to see beautiful landscapes, we desire beautiful women. Hearing, we want to hear pleasurable sounds, the softness of a woman's voice, the peaceful sound of the morning on a mountain. Taste, we seek delicious food from around the world, and we want to taste the best wine. Smell, we want to smell all the pleasurable perfume. Touch, we desire for sexual pleasure, which is one of the greatest desires a person has. I believe it is not wrong to seek pleasure for yourself, but it is wrong if the pleasure you are seeking directly or indirectly causes suffering to any other sentient being. By suffering, I mean either mental distress or physical pain inflicted on a sentient being. My reasoning is simple, If you don’t want to suffer, then you don’t make others suffer.

Then, why do we as intelligent beings create so much suffering on animals in exchange for the temporal pleasure of our mouths? Have we ever asked ourselves if the suffering these animals endure is worth the pleasure we gain by eating their flesh? There is no one with a rational mind can say yes to that question. If you are a normal person without any mental disorder, then there is a high chance that you once had a feeling of guilt deep inside your heart when you ate that burger or that chicken fried, you know deep down in your soul that it is wrong and to have that flesh, a cow, a chicken was killed young and intentionally, for you one to have that tasty flesh. Killing an innocent sentient being is immoral, but raising it for the whole purpose of killing it for one’s pleasure is psychologically broken. There is no justification to justify the act of killing for food because humans are omnivores, which means we don’t need meat to survive, we are not carnivores like lions or tigers.

Now, even if we all agree that there is no justification for our killing for taste, some people would argue that it doesn’t matter, in the end, humans only live once in this world, and after they die nothing matters anymore. It’s a very selfish argument. It is true that after one dies, one is done with this world, and nothing in this world can affect him anymore, assuming that he doesn’t believe in the afterlife and karma kinds of stuff, but why would one want to give away suffering while he is avoiding it? he knows how unpleasant it is to have a bleeding cut on his leg, but his food requires slitting the throat of another sentient being to death, how horrifying the physical and psychological that animal had suffered to deliver the meat for that barbecue? does anyone ever think about it?

Some may continue to argue that the animals he eats are humanly killed, the word humanly means “typical of human behaviors, thoughts, and feelings”, but when it is a norm to kill for food without any regard for the sentient animal that being killed, the word humanly doesn’t imply anything correlated with morality, it only implies that is the common way to do because everyone else does it. In a world where immorality is the norm, morality becomes the new immorality.

Are we so blinded by the media, the culture, the norm around us, and especially our desire for pleasure that we decided to close our eyes and allow this madness to continue? We are born with empathy and compassion, it is our nature but the environment around us has changed us to be ignorance. Do you remember when you were a little, how terrifying it was when you realized where the fried chicken and the steak on your plate came from? or at least have you ever witnessed that terrifying reaction from a child? or how many times do you hear a child tell his mother that he wants to be a vegan but receives a laugh from his mother?

Open your mind and try to face the truth. Our world is a hell for any species that is considered edible or tasty for humans. Ignoring it doesn’t solve the problem, the only way to make our world better for all living beings is to bravely face the truth and make small but consistent decisions every time you ask yourself what to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Your effort alone may not change the established industry, but what you will receive is free from guilt, you will no longer have that guilt of indirectly causing suffering to animals before you sleep, and you will be proud of yourself for making such a brave decision to go against the madness of this world. Together, we can gradually make this planet a heaven for all species to live and enjoy their lives.

Small decisions do have the ability to cause great results. Even one meal of meat-free count. If you have the luxury of choosing what to eat, then choose not to eat flesh. Our lives in this physical realm are short, if we all want to live happy lives then we should allow them to at least live their lives too.
